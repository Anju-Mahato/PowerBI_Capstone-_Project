# PowerBI_Capstone_Project
In my Capstone Project, I led the design and development of a tailored Power BI dashboard to address the specific business analytics needs of a retail dataset. Leveraging a deep understanding of the retail domain, I created a dashboard that showcased key performance metrics, sales trends, inventory levels, and customer behavior insights. By utilizing Power BI's interactive features and advanced data visualization capabilities, I transformed complex datasets into clear and actionable insights.
This dashboard provided stakeholders with critical visibility into essential aspects of the business, enabling swift and informed decision-making. Through iterative refinement, the dashboard became an indispensable tool for improving business performance. Its real-time updates and predictive analytics capabilities empowered the business to remain agile and responsive in a rapidly changing retail environment, driving growth and operational success.
